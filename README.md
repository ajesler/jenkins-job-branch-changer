# jenkins-job-branch-changer

Changes the git branch for a set of Jenkins jobs. This saves you from having to go to each job config page and change the branch manually.  


## TODO

- Click on logo to go to server
- Show current git branch assigned to jenkins job
- Better error handling - what if the config has no git branch setting?
- Do jobs get updated if popup is closed before request returns? Should this use a background/event page?
- Use chrome notifications to show failure/success?
